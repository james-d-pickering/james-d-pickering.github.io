Currently, I work at Aarhus University in <a href='https://chem.au.dk/en/research/research-areas-and-research-groups/physicalchemistry/surflab' target='_blank'> Surflab </a> with Tobias Weidner. I've previously worked with <a href='http://burt.chem.ox.ac.uk/Default.aspx' target='_blank'>Michael Burt</a> at the University of Oxford (postdoc), <a href='https://chem.au.dk/en/research/research-areas-and-research-groups/physicalchemistry/femtolab/' target='_blank'>Henrik Stapelfeldt</a> at Aarhus University (PhD), and <a href='http://brouard.chem.ox.ac.uk' target='_blank'>Mark Brouard</a> at the University of Oxford (MChem). My most recent CV is <a href='../pdfs/CV_JDP_2021.pdf' target='_blank'> linked here </a> if of interest. 

I have a long standing interest and passion for scientific education, and I've previously held lectureships and teaching fellowships at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester respectively, teaching physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate chemistry students. From December 2021, I will be starting a new position as a lecturer in physical chemistry at the University of Leicester. 


Outside science I enjoy cycling, running, weightlifting, playing the guitar (and music generally), playing Go, and reading. I also build guitar amps from time to time.
