Currently, I am a teaching-focussed lecturer in physical chemistry at the University of Leicester. I've previously worked in <a href='https://chem.au.dk/en/research/research-areas-and-research-groups/physicalchemistry/surflab' target='_blank'> Surflab </a> with Tobias Weidner (postdoc); <a href='http://burt.chem.ox.ac.uk/Default.aspx' target='_blank'>Michael Burt</a> at the University of Oxford (postdoc); <a href='https://chem.au.dk/en/research/research-areas-and-research-groups/physicalchemistry/femtolab/' target='_blank'>Henrik Stapelfeldt</a> at Aarhus University (PhD); and <a href='http://brouard.chem.ox.ac.uk' target='_blank'>Mark Brouard</a> at the University of Oxford (MChem). My most recent CV is <a href='../pdfs/CV_JDP_2021.pdf' target='_blank'> linked here </a> if of interest. 

I have a long standing interest and passion for scientific education, and I've previously held lectureships and teaching fellowships at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester respectively, teaching physical chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate chemistry students. 

Outside science I enjoy cycling, running, weightlifting, playing the guitar (and music generally), playing chess, and reading. I also build guitar amps from time to time.
