I have taught many courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics to undergraduate students from chemistry (and related disciplines). For some of these courses I have made full lecture handouts/problem sets, whereas for others I just have PDFs explaining tricky concepts (or things that my students found challenging). I have also made some similar documents that are more aimed at graduate level, for new graduate students or final year undergraduates. The links below contain all of these that I've currently made - it will be added to periodically. 

Some of them are older than others and probably could use a refresh. They are almost certainly not error-free - let me know of any you find.



### Full Handouts/Courses

#### Ultrafast Optics: For Chemists
<a href="../pdfs/ultrafast_optics_for_chemists_v1-1.pdf" target="_blank"> This handout </a> grew whilst I was preparing to give a short talk to my research group about ultrafast optics and lasers. Many people entering ultrafast spectroscopy from different backgrounds (such as biology or chemistry, rather than physics) can find using and understanding the ultrafast laser systems quite confusing and daunting at first (this described me when I started my PhD in 2015). Many books on this topic are undoubtedly rigorous and thorough, but also entirely inaccessible for somebody without a physics degree. This handout aims to bridge that gap, and is now published as a <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-3659-8' target='_blank'> book through IOPebooks </a>. This original handout talks a lot about a specific lab in Oxford in the latter sections - and some figures of the internal workings of a TOPAS OPA were removed (as this probably would get me in trouble with Light Conversion). 

#### Introductory Quantum Mechanics
This is the <a href="../pdfs/introductory_quantum.pdf" target="_blank">handout </a>for a six lecture course designed for chemistry undergraduates meeting quantum mechanics for the first time. There is minimal assumed knowledge and it ends up providing a basic understanding of rotational and vibrational quantisation of simple molecules. It is kept quite qualitative, so there is minimal maths. There is also an associated <a href="../pdfs/problems.pdf" target="_blank">problem set</a> with <a href="../pdfs/solutions.pdf" target="_blank">solutions.</a>

#### Data Analysis using Python 
This is the <a href="../pdfs/data_analysis_using_python_v3.pdf" target="_blank">handout </a> for a short course aimed to help undergraduate chemistry students with no knowledge of programming to be able make simple plots and figures using Python and Matplotlib (it's probably badly named as it doesn't really help you do any actual analysis in retrospect..). It will maybe be useful for anyone who wants to start using Python to generate figures (as everyone should). It could definitely use an update now my Python is less clunky. 

#### Simulating a Velocity-Map Imaging Spectrometer
This rather rambling and questionably complete <a href="../pdfs/vmi_simulation.pdf" target="_blank">document </a> was the culmination of one of the worst<sup>1</sup> things I've ever been asked to do in my life. I was mostly trying to find a good geometry for a velocity-map imaging spectrometer, but then ended up in a SIMION rabbit hole and it was all a fairly dark and depressing experience. Hopefully this document a) explains a bit about how VMI works; b) demonstrates that the geometry that Eppink and Parker made in the 80s is still basically fine for 99% of users; and c) helps people use SIMION (which is excellent software, looking back) and Lua without wanting to rend down their computer in a vat of acid after every work day. It's really aimed at new graduate students.

<sup>1</sup> At the time it was horrendous, but now I kind of miss electrostatic optics. The scientific equivalent of ultra-endurance cycling - awful at the time, but retrospectively fun.
### Short Explanatory Notes

#### Electromagnetic Waves
<a href='../pdfs/EM_waves.pdf' target='_blank'> This note </a> explains some concepts related to electromagnetic waves (namely, what a wavevector is, and what 'phase' means), and gives a general introduction to the physics. Students who aren't from a physics background find this challenging in my experience (I definitely did). It formed part of the appendix to my book too.

#### Statistical Mechanics: The Background
<a href="../pdfs/statmech.pdf" target="_blank">This note</a> walks through the background of statistical mechanics and tackles a simple problem of calculating the internal energy of a box of atoms starting just from quantum mechanical expressions for energy levels. Most confusion around statstical mechanics seems to arise from people not understanding the point of it, or understanding why we care about partition functions so much. Hopefully this goes some way to remedying the situation, and can convince you that it's really astoundingly beautiful.

#### Nuclear Spin Statistics
The influence of nuclear spin statistics on rotational spectra often seems confusing, and it can seem that there are a lot of formulae pulled out of nowhere to help explain what we see. This <a href="../pdfs/spin_statistics.pdf" target="_blank">short note</a> aims to explain the influence of nuclear spin statistics by considering the effect of a rotation on the total wavefunction of a diatomic molecule. It assumes you're reasonably adept with typical undergraduate chemist level quantum mechanics.

#### Combination Differences
This <a href="../pdfs/combination_differences.pdf" target="_blank">note </a> walks through the process of taking combination differences of lines in a rovibrational spectrum (a high resolution IR spectrum so that rotational lines are resolved as well as vibrational lines). By doing this you can find rotational constants for the different vibrational levels, and extrapolate back to an "equilibrium" rotational constant (if such a thing is meaningful - I didn't set the exam question). 

#### Matrix Multiplication
In my experience people tend to be fine with matrix multiplication when it's done on a matrix drawn out in full (so you can just go column by row etc..), but then fall apart when you write the matrix multiplication using summation notation (which is obviously a lot more powerful if you want to multiply a big matrix). This <a href="../pdfs/matrix_multiplication.pdf" target="_blank">note </a> explains how you do this, and what steps are legal/illegal when using the sum notation. 

#### Ultrafast Photochemistry
I made this <a href="../pdfs/Photochem_supplement.pdf" target="_blank">beautifully handwritten </a> document as a supplement to the slides of an photochemistry course I was teaching. I felt like some of the detail about ultrafast photochemistry was a bit missing, so made this as a supplement. 

#### Degeneracy in Molecular Term Symbols
This <a href="../pdfs/Moleculartermsymboldegeneracy.pdf" target="_blank">whiteboard </a> was made after a lockdown online tutorial in which one of my excellent students at Merton college pointed out that I'd been teaching this incorrectly for a whole year. It aims to explain why the degeneracy of a molecular term is not the standard 2J+1 (as in atoms), but is actually 2S+1. It boils down to how the angular momentum vectors are projected, and in molecules you project to the molecule-fixed axis not the space-fixed axis.
