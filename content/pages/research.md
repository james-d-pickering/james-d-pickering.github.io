My research broadly falls under the umbrella of "spectroscopy and dynamics", using light to understand chemical structure and dynamics. I am, however, probably more interested in the instrumentation needed to do this kind of science, than the actual science itself.  

I am quite into non-linear optics and non-linear spectroscopy, although my grasp of a lot of the underyling theory is quite pedestrian. In a similar vein, I would probably consider myself to be a laser enthusiast, so am always interested in big/powerful/broadband/interesting laser systems. I enjoy programming, and some programs I have made to assist in general lab work/data analysis are linked on the "programs" page - and more will be added when I get around to cleaning them up so they are shareable.  

For most of my research so far I have focussed on gas-phase (or quasi-condensed-phase) structure and dynamics, using femtosecond laser pulses. This was the focus of my MChem, PhD, and first postdoc. However, most recently I have been doing some more pure spectroscopy, working on non-linear surface spectroscopy in Surflab with Tobias Weidner. My PhD thesis is <a href="../pdfs/thesis_jdp_finalprint.pdf" target="_blank"> linked here </a>, if of interest (it contains many errors).
